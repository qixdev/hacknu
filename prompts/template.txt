            },
            "Trigonometry" : {

    "Biology" : {

    }
}
Important:
1. But in "grade", "numberOfQuestions",  "rightAnswer", "averageGrade" you add your random date because we does not have db where we take grades, because of you need add some values where it need.
2. You should't use data witch related with request only new like example above, for give material for learning you use "materials" it is a map, where inside it your given subject and struct.
3. Don't use repeated info:
{
    "attempts" : 2,
    "maxGrade" : 9,
    "maxQuestions" : 20,
    "results" : [4, 7],
}
4. Also Don't Return studentInfo Only "materials" and his data.
5. Important you should return only JSON that sold.
